                  Following the inconclusive outcome of the 2002 World Summit 
                  on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the failure of governments 
                  and global institutions to address social and environmental 
                  problems is glaringly obvious. We can no longer afford a global 
                  system that aims to represent us only in our narrow capacity 
                  as consumers. <br>
                  The <b>Earth Emergency - A Call to Action</b> initiative together 
                  with the <b>World Future Council</b> will seek to link up civil 
                  society initiatives around the world to promote the creation 
                  of an Earth Democracy forum for people around the world.<br>
                  A political and corporate 'bypass' is intended, due to the tendency 
                  of self-interested parties to prevent appropriate reforms, which 
                  address social and environmental problems, from being implemented.<b> 
                  The Earth Emergency</b> link up will enable grassroots initiatives 
                  based upon sustainable lifestyles to be directly in touch with 
                  an overall global council, the<b> World Future Council</b>, 
                  whose role will be to provide moral guidance at the highest 
                  level. This will ensure both a bottom up and top down approach 
                  to reforms so that our political leaders are pressurised to 
                  take appropriate action by both the people and a moral leadership.

                  <p>Throughout the world, agriculture is in crisis. Farmers are 
                    going bankrupt in record numbers, and the rural communities 
                    of which they are an integral part are being drained of life. 
                    Meanwhile, international trade in food is booming. Every year, 
                    the distance between producers and consumers rises, to the 
                    point where the average American meal has now travelled more 
                    than 1,500 miles before it arrives on the dinner table. These 
                    two trends are directly linked. The globalisation of the food 
                    economy, while enriching a small number of giant 'agribusinesses', 
                    is undermining the welfare of everyone else. What's more, 
                    it is a major contributor to increasing CO2 emissions, and 
                    therefore to climate change. Read about ISEC Local Food Programme.

                  <p>An unstable economy that has suffered multiple currency devaluations 
                    and sky-high unemployment in recent years has driven down 
                    labour costs throughout Russia, so that now people will often 
                    accept whatever jobs they can get, regardless of the working 
                    conditions. This situation is especially dire in cities like 
                    Vladivostok, where a severe shortage of jobs, crumbling social 
                    services, and an outdated internal registration system which 
                    prevents people from moving to more "prosperous" regions, 
                    have made residents even more desperate. Visit <a href="http://www.nosweat.org.uk">No

                  <p><br>
                    The International Forum on Globalization (IFG) is an alliance 
                    of sixty leading activists, scholars, economists, researchers 
                    and writers formed to stimulate new thinking, joint activity, 
                    and public education in response to economic globalization. 
                    Representing over 60 organizations in 25 countries, IFG associates 
                    come together out of a shared concern that the world's corporate 
                    and political leadership is undertaking a restructuring of 
                    global politics and economics that may prove as historically 
                    significant as any event since the Industrial Revolution. 
                    This restructuring is happening at tremendous speed, with 
                    little public disclosure of the profound consequences affecting 
                    democracy, human welfare, local economies, and the natural 
                    world. Read more about The International Forum on Globalization.

                    Consumers and environmentalists across Europe have taken up 
                    the campaign against GMOs. This has received much attention 
                    in the British media and we are winning change. Yet these 
                    changes will not solve the problem for some of the world's 
                    most poor and vulnerable. The World Development Movement (WDM) 
                    is concerned that GM crops are being pushed on developing

                    In the UK we produce 414 million tonnes of waste each year

                  <p><br>
                    says a report by the Woodland Trust. Fifty per cent of the 
                    UK's ancient woodland has been lost since the 1930s and only 
                    two per cent of the total land area is now covered by ancient 
                    woodland. A number of factors, including higher temperatures 
                    and changes in rainfall patterns, will have a dramatic impact 
                    on ancient woodland, the survival of which hangs very much 
                    in the balance. Visit the Woodland Trust's website. </p>
