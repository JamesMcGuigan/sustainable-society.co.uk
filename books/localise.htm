"Now is the time for a comprehensive and radical alternative which must be based on a new direction for the global economic system.  It must reduce inequality, improve the basic provision of needs, and adequately protect the environment.  Its end goal must be to endure, aid and increase the democratic control and involvement of citizens in the rebuilding of sustainable local economies.  A Protect the Local, Globally approach.<BR>
This process is Localization - a set of interrelated and self-reinforcing policies that actively discriminate in favour of the local.  It provides a political and economic framework for people, community groups and businesses to rediversify their own local economies."<BR><P>
"Localization can foster and build sustainable local communities to help rebuild local economies.  It allows the achievement of social cohesion and economic renewal particularly through investment in labour-intensive, infrastructural renewal and face-to-face caring.  Local businesses have a central role and much to gain.<BR>
Protective safeguards, such as import and export controls, quotas, subsidies, etc, will need to be introduced over a clearly agreed transition period to all continents. .... The emphasis will be on local trade.  Any residual long-distance trade will be geared to funding the diversification of local economies.<BR>
Industry will be localized by site-here-to-sell-here policies to ensure localized production." <BR><P>

"What is required is a regrounding of money to remain predominantly in the locality or country of origin to fund the rebuilding of diverse, sustainable local economies.  Measures include controls on capital flows, Tobin-type taxes, control of tax evasion, including offshore banking centres, the floating of civic bonds and the rejuvenation of locally orientated banks, credit unions, LETS schemes, etc."
