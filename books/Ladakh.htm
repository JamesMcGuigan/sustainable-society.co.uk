"Over the last decades, diverse cultures from Alaska to Australia have been overrun by the industrial monoculture.  Today's conquistadors are "development", advertising, the media, and tourism.  Across the world, "Dallas" beams into people's homes and pinstripe suits are de rigueur.  This year I have seen almost identical toy shops appear in Ladakh and in a remote mountain village of Spain.  They both sell the same blonde, blue-eyed Barbie dolls and Rambos with machine guns.
The spread of the industrial monoculture is a tragedy of many dimensions.  With the destruction of each culture, we are erasing centuries of accumulated knowledge, and as diverse ethnic groups feel their identity threatened, conflict and social breakdown almost inevitably follow.
Increasingly, Western culture is coming to be seen as the normal way, the only way.  And as more and more people around the world become competitive, greedy, and egotistical, these traits tend to be attributed to human nature.  Despite persistent voices to the contrary, the dominant thinking in Western society has long assumed that we are indeed aggressive by nature, locked in a perpetual Darwinian struggle.  The implications of this view for the way we structure our society are of fundamental importance."

"Without retreating into cultural or economic isolationism, we can nourish the traditions of our own region.  A true appreciation of cultural diversity means neither imposing our own culture on others, nor packaging, exploiting, and commercialising exotic cultures for our own consumption.
One of the most effective ways of reviving cultural differences would be to lobby for a reduction in unnecessary trade.  At the moment, our taxpayers' money is going to expand transport infrastructures and to increase trade for the sake of trade.  We are transporting across whole continents a vast range of products, from milk to apples to furniture, that could just as easily be produced in their place of destination.  What we should be doing instead is reinforcing and diversifying local economies.  By reducing and eliminating subsidies for transportation, we would cut waste and pollution, improve the position of small farmers, and strengthen communities in one fell swoop.
What exactly is "local", and what is "necessary" as opposed to "unnecessary" trade, are issues that cannot be defined in absolute terms.  But the crucial point is that the 'principle' of heavily subsidized international trade is one that needs critical reassessment-not with the goal of encouraging protectionism, but so as to allow for the sustainable and equitable use of natural resources worldwide.  It is in robust, local-scale economies that we find genuinely "free" markets; free of the corporate manipulation, hidden subsidies, waste, and immense promotional costs that characterize today's global market."

Ladakh, or 'Little Tibet', is a wildly beautiful desert land up in the Western Himalayas.  It is a place of few resources and an extreme climate.  Yet for more than a thousand years, it has been home to a thriving culture.  Tradition of frugality and cooperation, coupled with an intimate and location-specific knowledge of the environment, enabled the Ladakhis not only to survive, but to prosper.  Everyone had enough to eat; families and communities were strong; the status of women was high.
Then came 'development'.  Now in the modern sector one finds pollution and divisiveness, inflation and unemployment, intolerance and greed.  Centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of Western consumerism.
'Ancient Futures' is much more than a book about Ladakh.  Passionately argued, it raises important questions about the whole notion of progress, and explores the root causes of the malaise of industrial society.  At the same time, the story of Ladakh serves as a source of inspiration for our own future.  It shows us that another way is possible, and points to some of the first steps towards kinder, gentler patterns of living.
