          <em>A Guide for Enlightened Leaders &#8212; what Companies and Individuals 
          can Do </em><br>
          <br>
          Bruce Nixon &#8220;What if we discover our present way of life is irreconcilable 
          with our vocation to become fully human?&#8221; <br>
          <br>
          Paulo Freire 
        The horror of 11th September, and what followed, shocked the world and 
          left many of us reflecting deeply, as we recovered from something imagined, 
          but never expected. It is now more obvious that the world is a living 
          system in which everything is interconnected, vulnerable and unpredictable. 
          It is indeed one world and what happens in other cultures and the less 
          economically developed world affects us all. It is dawning on us that 
          we have to be world citizens if we are to enjoy a sustainable future. 
          Maybe globalisation is really &#8220;Americanisation&#8221; or &#8220;Westernisation&#8221;, 
          not working in the best interests of ordinary people throughout the world 
          and not sustainable? If we do not learn willingly, perhaps the Universe 
          forces it on us. <br>
          <br>
          More and more, people are concerned about how globalisation is affecting 
          society, businesses, people all over the world and the Earth. What are 
          the big issues confronting us? What are the implications for organisations 
          and people everywhere? How can leaders at every level grasp the new opportunities, 
          create better and more successful workplaces and contribute to a fair 
          and sustainable world? What can we do?
          <br>
          <br>
          Bruce gives a graphic account of globalisation, the big issues that 
          face us and how our consciousness is transforming. He presents, in an 
          accessible way, new thinking about organisations and leadership and processes 
          and tools to enable leaders to release creativity in organisations or 
          communities and help people thrive in an uncertain, chaotic transforming 
          world. <br>
          <br>
          He has written this book because he believes that increasing awareness 
          and understanding of the issues and seeing the challenges as opportunities 
          will help human beings find ways forward. 
        The book is in five parts: <br>
          <br>
&middot; Part one, Global Forces-a Crazy World describes globalisation; 
          technological revolution; the way business and society are transforming 
          and the effects on us all - the upside and downside <br>
          <br>
&middot; Part two, The Big Issues focuses on the big issues emerging from 
          globalisation: how they are inter-related; the growing power of transnational 
          corporations; the power and instability of financial markets; the growing 
          gap between rich and poor; the ecological crisis and sustainability; the 
          need for corporate world citizenship; and the long story of difference 
          and diversity. It gives good news about what many organisations and individuals 
          are doing in response to these issues but points out the threats and need 
          for reform of world institutions. <br>
          <br>
&middot; Part three, Our Transforming Consciousness describes how, in 
          a transforming world, the way we think about society, organisations and 
          leadership is changing and a new consciousness is emerging part of which 
          is respect for difference and cultural diversity and the quest for meaning 
          and balance<br>
          <br>
&middot; Part four, Tools for the Age of the Global Economy offers tools 
          to help leaders at every level facilitate transformation and release the 
          creativity and energy in their organisations; it includes two case studies <br>
          <br>
&middot; Part five, A New Beginning describes and guides you through a 
          process to use in developing a new strategy for your organisation or your 
          life or both<br>

                  book to be such a riveting read. I was constantly saying &quot;yes&quot; to myself as Bruce pointed out in an accessible and refreshing way what 
                  should be obvious to all of us. I would recommend this book to anyone 
                  who wants to build up a successful business and stay way ahead of the 
                  competition. Bruce provides the insight necessary to create a company 
                  that can really make a difference. Businesses that recognise the importance 
                  of attracting and keeping good people, will not only provide an environment 
                  in which the best people want to work, they will also achieve great and

&#8220;An easy read and a breath of fresh air&#8230;.a work full of 
                  optimism. It draws together so many highly impressive day-to-day examples 
                  and practices from business and commercial life that only the terminally 
                  depressed will fail to recognise that there is a healthy and growing trend 
                  towards a collaborative, inclusive approach to the world. This approach 
                  can be seen working within the business and other spheres, and Bruce is 
                  most persuasive when he advocates that it can help us achieve the kind 
                  of sustainable way of life sought by so many. By definition, if you don&#8217;t 
                  use the right means, you don&#8217;t achieve the right result. Sustainability 
                  necessitates new ways of behaving inside companies, families, social groups, 
                  and beyond. The author provides useful techniques to help individuals 
                  and organisations change by adopting new attitudes to the things that 
                  matter.</em><br>
                  <em>That we cannot hope to continue in the old way becomes increasingly evident 
                  as one turns the pages of this book. So does the conclusion that Bruce&#8217;s 
                  approach offers the only real alternative for business, society, and the 
                  individuals who make up that society.&#8221;<br>

      <em>&#8220;I loved it! &#8220;Global Forces&#8221; is a wonderful balance 
                  between the engaging and the enduring; a good read and an indispensable 
                  addition to the reference section of anyone's library. I never dreamed 
                  that I could read a book on the global economy that would have me at the 
                  edge of my seat, nor one in which I would find such a weight of statistics 
                  so relevant and enlightening. I really enjoy the way the global economy 
                  is placed in such a clear and understandable historical context. The book 
                  illustrates very well the compelling interrelationship and interdependence 
                  of the interests of the &quot;first&quot; world and what should perhaps 
                  be more accurately described as the &quot;two-thirds&quot; world. And 
                  all of it clearly written and immediately accessible. UK examples makes 
                  this a particularly valuable addition to the growing wealth of material 
                  written on the subject of new - or should it more accurately be old - 
                  leadership. <br>
                  I found myself through all the sections of the book poised with a pencil 
                  and writing again and again in the margin things like &quot;great quote&quot;,
        &#8220; interesting statistic&quot;, &quot;good angle&quot;, &quot;must 
                  use this&quot; and, simply, &quot;Yes!&quot; <br>
                  And finally, I got into the routine of reading the book on the train going 
                  home after work each day and perhaps the strongest recommendation I can 
                  give to &quot;Global Forces&#8221; is the number of occasions I deliberately 
                  missed my station so that I didn't have to stop reading! It's an important 
                  book.&#8221; <br>

      <em>&#8220;Bruce Nixon in his new book &#8220;Global Forces - a Guide for 
                  Enlightened Leaders&#8221; discusses some of the big issues that are being 
                  thrown up by change and are challenging us as individuals and in our organisations 
                  to work out new ways of working. agree with his belief that it is important 
                  to identify the inter-relationship between them and the need for holistic 
                  solutions. He cites the growing search for meaning and balance and identifies 
                  the importance of leadership in espousing the values so essential for 
                  encouraging sustainable culture change and the development of trust, creativity

&#8220;Global Forces is not a book that should be read either quickly 
                  or by people who are uncomfortable with the idea of change. If you are 
                  serious about examining how to change both yourself and your organization, 
                  then this book is well worth reading. If, however, you are looking for 
                  a &quot;how- to&quot; manual that can be applied in all situations, then 
                  you would be better off looking elsewhere.&#8221;<br>

      <em>&quot;Global Forces&quot; provides a fascinating commentary on the many 
                  issues confronting today's world. Refreshingly free of jargon the book 
                  flows effortlessly over the complex and diverse, though also connected, 
                  forces at work in both our global and local societies. It is as though 
                  the author is inviting us to travel along with him as he reflects on these 
                  and points to both the upside and the downside in each. This is not a 
                  book defining solutions. But a guided tour of the issues by Bruce Nixon 
                  does much to help our understanding and to provide us with a vision of 
                  hope that a sustainable and fairer world is there to be created. If the 
                  book is for leaders, then maybe we are all in some sense leaders. The 
                  book has a message for each one of us, whether our level of responsibility 
                  be managing the global economy, guiding a teenage daughter or somewhere 
                  in between.&quot;</em><br>

      <em>&#8220;The emphasis on quality leadership in today&#8217;s world and 
                  the need for reflective thinking to achieve this is inescapable. Most 
                  successful organisations are built on good relationships. A leader in 
                  today&#8217;s world, whether it be the leader of a small company or of 
                  a large multi-national, must be able to model those relationships. As 
                  an educational leader striving to balance the external changes and the 
                  pressures with the maintenance of personal values and integrity, I found 
                  the breadth of information and the wide context given in this book provided 
                  me with much food for thought.&#8221;</em> Julia Trueman, <strong>Head Teacher, Tring
