"It is not hard to see the connection between consumer demand and damage to the environment.  What is not so obvious, but many people now believe to be the case, is that the present economic system, which compels governments and corporations to strive for 'economic growth', actually produces negative net benefits for society: our economic system is the fundamental cause of the growing gap between rich and poor and the destruction of the environment. [....] attempts by governments to alleviate the conditions of the less well off and limit the environmental damage caused by 'economic growth' address the symptoms, not the cause.  The only cure is to change the system.<BR>
<BR>By 'economic systems' I refer to money systems and the rules governing markets, trade and corporations etc, ie the systems by which we manage the economic activities of production, distribution and consumption etc.  The good news is that economic systems are man-made: they can be changed.  The ideal would be a set of economic systems that would enable the whole of humanity to live healthy lives, would help to promote just and harmonious societies and would do so without diminishing the capacity of Nature to sustain life.  Fortunately, 'new economics' have  begun to  offer us alternative economic systems that are specifically designed to achieve these desirable ends.  Support for these ideas is spreading.  London's long term future as a financial centre depends on adopting and promoting these ideas, not just at the margins of the economy but in lieu of the 'growth economy'.  London, this great world city, could lead the way in exploring these new ideas and bringing about the changes needed."
