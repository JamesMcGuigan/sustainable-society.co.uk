<strong>James Robertson - Beyond the Dependency Culture</strong><br>
<br>

"Following scientists like Jullian Huxley and mystics like Theiland de Chardin, increasing numbers of us feel that progress is connected with the evolution of consciousness. We feel that social progress is to do with an increase in people's capacity for self-development, and we are coming to see a progressive society as one which positively enables its people and its communities to develop themselves.  The mechanistic models of Newtonian science and utilitarian philosophy are losing their energising power as vehicles for the idea of progress.  They are being replaced by the developmental models of biology, psychologt and evolution."<br>
<br>

"Increasingly we feel that progress requires us to throw off the domination of big corporations, big government, the mass media, the powerful trade unions, the professonal monopolies (for example, in education, medicine and the law), the big money-dealers like banks and building societies - in fact, to liberate ourselves from excessive dependency on the whole complex of formal institutions which make up the over-developed, over-extended modern state."  <br>
<br>


"An immature society is one whose members have their values and their responsibilities externally define and imposed, for example by commercial advertisers and by agencies of government; a mature society is one whose members define their own needs and assume their own responsibilities.  The consumer society plus welfare state is, in this reckoning, an immature society in a state of dependency.  A more adult society will be one whose members are more self-reliant and more self-responsible."<br>
