      <h2> <span STYLE="color:darkorange">eGaia, Growing a peaceful, sustainable Earth through communications <br></span></h2>
       <strong>A book for the social visionary</strong> <br>
        Feeling powerless? Do you yearn to move beyond protest and cynicism 
        towards a positive vision? Then you may like Gary Alexander's eGaia, Growing 
        a peaceful, sustainable Earth through communications. The style is light 
        and easy, full of little stories, sprinkled with cartoons, and with disarming 
        fragments of dialogue between author and reader that pre-empt the reader's 
        objections. He is very good at articulating the kind of radical vision 
        that many people have been musing upon. It goes well beyond reform to 
        a genuinely co-operative, self-governing society that looks after the 
        environment. There are certainly the beginnings of that around, with new 
        economic experiments such as microfinance and local currencies, new co-operatives 
        and communities, and a large group of people who put their energy into 
        protest and who could put some into new social forms. No need to wait 
        until Green parties come to power to begin. Gary Alexander's added ingredient, 
        which just might be that extra bit to make it take off, is communication. 
        He envisages lots of local groups - islands of relative sanity - using 
        communication technology to link up to form a network of growing sanity. 
        His emphasis on learning practical skills of understanding each other 
        are common practises in conflict resolution. He uses communication in 
        two senses, as it should be, as a social skill and as technology that 
        is there to support it. A cynic might say, "But isn't competition the 
        basis of evolution and aren't people inherently competitive?" A fascinating 
        chapter presents the evolution of life from a perspective in which symbiosis 
        is at least as important as competition. It shows the co-operative roots 
        of human evolution and describes how we have become progressively more 
        detached from the natural world and each other over more recent history. 
        A crucial issue the book tackles is 'how do you get around the problem 
        that most economic activity is driven by the need for money instead of 
        directly by social and environmental need?' The answers in eGaia are to 
        provide information about 'real costs' (the impact of consuming something 
        on the environment and its social costs), and to build a new Fair Trade 
        co-operative economy around existing groups where a relationship of trust 
        exists. This is perhaps not the whole answer, but it is a useful contribution 
        to the discussion. There is a good review of principles of sustainability, 
        such as food and land use, sustainable energy and methods of production. 
        Although it would have been good to have more detail on the transition 
        from the starting points he describes to the end vision. This book is 
        important. Read it and tell your friends about it. 
      Dr Gary Alexander is one of the Open University's pioneers of online 
        learning.
