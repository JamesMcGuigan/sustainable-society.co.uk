<p>The purpose of the
<span class="firebrick"><b><i>Sustainable Society</i></b></span><b><i>DIRECTORY</i></b>
is to offer a clear and comprehensive guide to environmental issues. The several links will allow research on the policies and actions of each organisation. It is hoped that this will allow individuals to get a clearer view of what is happening world-wide, behind the news propagated by the media. It is clear that the present economic system is flawed. We are ruled by financial institutions and corporations which act together to prevent governments around the world to take action against major issues such as global warming and air, soil, water and food pollution. Cultural, social and ecological diversity needs to be protected and more people are now realising the importance of policies that create local self-sufficiency. The resources of the planet are limited and a sustainable future will only be achieved if the human kind will radically reduce waste, switch to alternative energies, stop destroying woodlands, polluting seas, fresh water reserves and soil.
