                        occupation which fully respects other people and the natural 

                        world. It means being responsible for the consequences 

                        of our actions and taking only a fair share of the earth's 

                        resources. In every generation, there are groups of people

                        The Common Agricultural Policy has damaging effects on 

                        the environment, farming traditions, rural communities, 

                        consumer health and poorer countries. Working with its 

                        membership, Sustain advocates reform of the CAP to address 

                        these issues. We also work to improve policies in related 

                        areas such as rural development and support for organic 

                        farming and other forms of sustainable food production.
