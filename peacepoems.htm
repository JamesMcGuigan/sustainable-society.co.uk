        Why We Are Here [ Seattle ]<br>
        <br>
        Because the world we imagined, the one<br>
        we had always counted on<br>
        is disappearing.<br>
        Because the sun has become cancerous<br>
        and the planet is getting hotter.<br>
        Because children are starving in the shadows <br>
        of yachts and economic summits.<br>
        Because there are already too many planes in the sky.<br>
        <br>
        This is the manufactured world<br>
        you have come here to codify and expedite.<br>
        We have come to tell you<br>
        there is something else we want to buy.<br>
        <br>
        What we want, money no longer recognises<br>
        like the vitality of nature, the integrity of work.<br>
        We don't want cheaper wood, we want living trees.<br>
        We don't want engineered fruit, we want to see and smell the<br>
        food growing in our own neighbourhoods.<br>
        <br>
        We are here because a voice inside us, <br>
        a memory in our blood, tells us<br>
        you are not just a trade body, you are the blind tip<br>
        of a dark wave that has forgotten its source.<br>
        We are here to defend and honour<br>
        what is real, natural, human and basic<br>
        against the rising tide of greed.<br>
        <br>
        We are here by the insistence of spirit <br>
        and the authority of nature.<br>
        If you doubt for one minute the power of truth<br>
        or the primacy of nature<br>
        try not breathing for that length of time.<br>
        <br>
        Now you know the pressure of our desire.<br>
        We are not here to tinker with your laws.<br>
        We are here to change you from the inside out.<br>
        This is not a political protest.<br>
        It is an uprising of the soul.<br>
        <br>

        Why We Are Here [ London Feb 15th 2003]<br>
        <br>
        Because the world we have long hoped-for ,<br>
        The one we have been counting on,<br>
        Is about to be destroyed.<br>
        Because democracy is threatened<br>
        By a few unrepresentative<br>
        Rabid power-seeking war-mongers.<br>
        Because power and profits<br>
        Are being put before people.<br>
        Because our natural world is becoming unnaturally<br>
        Governed by military-industrial vested interests.<br>
        <br>
        We have come to demonstrate that<br>
        There are more important aims to address,<br>
        Such as peace and freedom and justice for all.<br>
        <br>
        We are here because a voice inside us says<br>
        The fate of the world should not be decided<br>
        By a few power-hungry oil interests.<br>
        We are here to defend and honour<br>
        What is real, natural, human and basic<br>
        Against the rising tide of greed.<br>
        <br>
        We are here by the insistence of spirit<br>
        And the authority of nature.<br>
        To demonstrate that the time has come<br>
        To express our democratic right<br>
        Not to be passively manipulated.<br>
        We are here to change the threatening course of events,<br>
        To express the mass voice of democratic dissent,.<br>
        This is an uprising of the collective soul.<br>

        Why are we here ? [ London Feb 15th 2003 ]<br>
        <br>
        Because we want world security<br>
        not war; we anticipate afoot an <br>
        uprising of the soul of sanity,<br>
        not a conflictual political protest.<br>
        <br>
        We march our global cri de coeur<br>
        for justice in all structures;<br>
        a yearning to end poverty,<br>
        not a provocation to war.<br>
        <br>
        We see sanity receding <br>
        as imbecilic mechanistic logic rules;<br>
        a cause for people world-wide gathering<br>
        for peace, the majority now interceding.<br>
        <br>
        We want one world secure <br>
        in honoured rich diversity,<br>
        sane in its mutual trading,<br>
        sensible to inclusiveness.<br>
        <br>
        We march peaceably<br>
        unable to sit idly by or <br>
        rush like lemmings to despair -<br>
        we ask to be heard response-ably.<br>
        <br>
        We echo Seattle, Genoa, Port Alegro <br>
        and a world-wide crescendo of assemblies, <br>
        compelled 'by the insistence of spirit'<br>
        called by 'the authority of nature'.<br>
        <br>
        We believe in the genuine <br>
        power of powerlessness,<br>
        not the power of exploitation;<br>
        thus we march in longing.<br>
        <br>
        Unarmed we share responsibility <br>
        for the world entire <br>
        and in our magnanimity want <br>
        none excluded from the abundance<br>
        of this awesome planet earth. <br>
        <br>
        In a world in deep disarray,<br>
        terrorism is despair triumphant,<br>
        justice the only committed hope...<br>
        for there is no way to peace<br>
        peace is the way.<br>

        15.3.2003: Why we are here<br>
        <br>
        The instability of war:<br>
        In war you pull a trigger - fire a missile<br>
        That's Easy!<br>
        And the consequences are unpredictable<br>
        - except for agony and death<br>
        <br>
        The stability of peace:<br>
        In peace you work in the fields- and plant seeds<br>
        That's Hard Work!<br>
        And the consequences are unpredictable<br>
        - except for aches and getting a life<br>
        ------------<br>
        The unsustainability of war<br>
        War is fed by money, hate and anger<br>
        That's Easy!<br>
        But the consequences are predictable<br>
        - lies, agony and death<br>
        <br>
        The sustainability of peace:<br>
        Peace is fed by effort, partnership and love<br>
        That's Hard Work!<br>
        But the consequences are predictable<br>
        - truth, aches, and a life to live<br>
