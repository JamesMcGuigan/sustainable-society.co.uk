            <p>&quot;It is not hard to see the connection between consumer demand 
              and damage to the environment. What is not so obvious, but many 
              people now believe to be the case, is that the present economic 
              system, which compels governments and corporations to strive for 
              'economic growth', actually produces negative net benefits for society: 
              our economic system is the fundamental cause of the growing gap 
              between rich and poor and the destruction of the environment. [....] 
              attempts by governments to alleviate the conditions of the less 
              well off and limit the environmental damage caused by 'economic 
              growth' address the symptoms, not the cause. The only cure is to 
              change the system. <br>
              By 'economic systems' I refer to money systems and the rules governing 
              markets, trade and corporations etc, ie the systems by which we 
              manage the economic activities of production, distribution and consumption 
              etc. The good news is that economic systems are man-made: they can 
              be changed. The ideal would be a set of economic systems that would 
              enable the whole of humanity to live healthy lives, would help to 
              promote just and harmonious societies and would do so without diminishing 
              the capacity of Nature to sustain life. Fortunately, 'new economics' 
              have begun to offer us alternative economic systems that are specifically 
              designed to achieve these desirable ends. Support for these ideas 
              is spreading. London's long term future as a financial centre depends 
              on adopting and promoting these ideas, not just at the margins of 
              the economy but in lieu of the 'growth economy'. London, this great 
              world city, could lead the way in exploring these new ideas and 
              bringing about the changes needed.&quot; </p>
