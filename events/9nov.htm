WTO: Abolish or Reform?<BR>

This Public Debate, purposively timed to shadow the WTO ministerial meeting in Qatar, promises to be a lively discussion which not only focuses critique on how the WTO currently operates, but which seeks to really start to address an analysis of possible solutions to it's current role; A key objective is to raise the controversial subject of to what extent a reformed WTO might be the most achievable means to strike a balance between poverty alleviation, environmental justice, sustainable agriculture in the North and trade liberalisation; Pre-empting this of course will recognition of how current WTO regulations sustain the encroachment of large-scale enterprise, for instance in the food chain, where farmer's profit-margin is siphoned-off by Agribusiness, who turn cheap ingredients (production subsidised by taxpayers) into expensive products; Will getting rid of subsidies as part of the new Agreement on Agriculture have any effect on these deep structural problems within the UK food and farming sector?; How does the WTO help to sustain these trends within the whole international trading system? Why are transnational corporations being allowed to dictate the WTO agenda, loading it with new items such as government procurement, services and investment within the new General Agreement on Trade inServices (GATS)?<BR><P>





The <SPAN STYLE="color: FireBrick">Legacy of Colonialism Forum </SPAN>is a new initiative foractivists, 

development NGOs, environmental groups, researchers and grassroot 

development workers all over the world, to share information about how 

genuine self-determination - whether that be indigenous groups or civil 

society - can be sought in the face of neocolonial economic and 

political relations; corporate domination - the logical conclusion to a 

legacy of colonialism. The Land Is Ours (based in the UK), who have launched this forum, seek to encourage an exploration of deeper underlying factors in the world economy which prevent genuine self determination from happening, such as the economic fraud of global institutions and the debt-based money system. The objective is to raise the issue of: firstly, reforming the financial system as it stands; secondly, debt cancellation married to the moral imperative of reparation for the crimes of slavery; colonialism and it's legacy - a world economy dominated by the unregulated plunder of international shareholder capital; thirdly, providing compensation for self-determination on the widest possible scale and gearing trade policy in favour of local needs.<br>
