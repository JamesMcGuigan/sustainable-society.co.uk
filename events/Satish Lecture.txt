You are, Therefore I am
A declaration of Dependence

'I Think Therefore, I Am' said French philosopher René Descartes.
This one thought has dominated Western philosophy, science, economics,
politics and even religion. In the wake of the Earth Summit at Johannesburg,
Satish Kumar's book is a timely challenge to our divided world. The time has
come when we need to move on from Descartes and address the issues of our
time
from a different perspective.

A lecture at the Salon des Arts by Satish Kumar,
