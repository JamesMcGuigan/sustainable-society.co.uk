      AMED is pleased to host an innovative and participative forum on the 

        challenges facing leading businesses in the global economy. Barry Coates 

        will introduce the evening with a provocative analysis of the economic, 

        ethical and environmental crisis facing much of the world. 

      Participants will have opportunities for questioning, discussing and 

        shaping a coherent response at the personal, organisational and societal 

        levels. The focus will be on how we can play a role in shaping organisations

        individual citizens can do.
