<H2 class="titles">"Creating New Money: A Monetary Reform for the Information Age"</H2>



<H3 class="comment">Open Meeting, House of Lords, 6pm-9pm, 20 June 2001<BR><P>





<SPAN STYLE="color: OrangeRed">Professor Joseph Huber</SPAN> and <SPAN STYLE="color: OrangeRed">James Robertson</SPAN>, co-authors of this report, will be presenting its findings for discussion at an open meeting organised by the<SPAN STYLE="color: FireBrick"> Forum for Stable Currencies</SPAN> in the Moses Room in the House of Lords at 6pm-9pm on 20 June.<BR>



The 92-page report was published by the  <SPAN STYLE="color: FireBrick">New Economics Foundation</SPAN> in June 2000. It has been favourably reviewed, and discussed in conferences and seminars in this country and elsewhere -  including Brussels, Dublin, Tokyo, and Germany.<BR>



It proposes that central banks should take direct responsibility for creating all new money, and should credit it to their governments to spend into circulation. At present, commercial banks print most of it out of thin air as profit-making loans to their customers. The report estimates that this gives UK banks a hidden subsidy of over £2Obn a year, and that the proposed reform could bring in public revenue of well over £4Obn a year. This could be used to reduce taxes, increase public spending, or both, to levels that would meet the tax and spending proposals of all the main UK political parties in the recent general election.<BR>



The proposed change is relevant to questions about inadequate competition and excessive profits in the banking industry. The report also explains the wider economic, social and environmental arguments for it.</H2>
