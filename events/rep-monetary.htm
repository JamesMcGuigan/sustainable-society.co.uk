      <p>GETTING REAL WITH THE GREATEST GLOBAL ILLUSION: MONEY!<br>
        A definition of money (courtesy of Michael Linton):<br>
        &#8216;Money is the stuff which isn&#8217;t real, which you accept for 
        stuff which is real, so you can get real stuff yourself.&#8217;<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Wendy Olsen</span> introduced the speakers and 
        mentioned a new radio station: Resonance FM (104.4) which will air the 
        event at some time in the future (see website: www.resonancefm.com).</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">James Robertson</span> began by explaining that 
        in joining the Euro the UK would be undertaking a profoundly undemocratic 
        act. It would reduce control over our economic lives in the UK and in 
        our role in monetary reform. There is however no reason why both the pound 
        and the Euro cannot be used in the UK, as indeed it already is. The majority 
        of people do not understand the effects of such a change in the money 
        supply nor that money can be used to keep people dependent and in that 
        respect represents power. 95% of loans are created from private banks 
        where the interest charges are reflected in the huge profits of the banks. 
        This gives a total &#8216;free lunch&#8217; to the private banks of around 
        &pound;20 billion per year in the UK. The public income from notes and 
        coins amounts to around &pound;3 million, but if currency was introduced 
        from public sources the income that would be generated would be around 
        &pound;45 billion per year for the public purse. What is required is a 
        debt free money supply which would reduce the levels of private debt and 
        stabilise the economy. Environmental campaigners are now beginning to 
        see the need for monetary reform as part of the process to move towards 
        a genuinely democratic, sustainable world. Indeed money system reform 
        is one of the key challenges facing humanity in the first quarter of the 
        21st Century. A fair and efficient system is required. LETS and other 
        alternative currencies are useful and pluralistic, but also a genuine 
        global currency is required. A world currency at the global level could 
        be used to prevent national governments such as the US (through seigniorage 
        of the dollar) receiving an annual &#8216;tribute&#8217; from the rest 
        of the world estimated at $400 billion at least, and provide a fund for 
        public revenue which could be spent on behalf of the world community by 
        the UN or a similar body. Suggestions for individual action included studying 
        the subject, persuading other pressure groups to take the issue seriously, 
        writing to your MP, particularly in support of the EDM 854 (see website: 
        http://edm.ais.co.uk).</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Michael Rowbotham</span> spoke of the distinction 
        between money and real wealth (goods and services). He explained the problem 
        of currency devaluation which occurred in South Africa when the Rand fell 
        to 1/3 of its original value. In real terms this meant that 1/3 of the 
        revenue from exports was received and the price of imports was 3 times 
        greater. In order to overcome the problem the country became a mass exporter, 
        but the revenues were still not enough, so the exports continued. This 
        has led to selling of the assets of the county such as land, mineral rights, 
        docks, electricity and water systems in order to meet IMF debt demands. 
        There are many countries in this position now. Corporations can thus &#8216;pick 
        and choose&#8217; from all these nations which are &#8216;selling off 
        the family silver&#8217; of their assets. Hence much of the land and natural 
        resources as well as capital investments of many developing countries 
        are now owned by institutions outside the country&#8217;s borders. Money 
        should be a &#8216;register&#8217; of the value of goods and services, 
        but NOT a commodity itself: it should not be traded as such. A register 
        of values of commodities could be used to ensure that a very similar price 
        is received for all specific type goods of similar quality globally in 
        order to prevent producers making products priced to undermine the same 
        quality product from another source. This would help to provide a common 
        value to wealth which is fundamentally democratic: in other words a fair 
        trading system.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Mary Mellor</span> explained that the issue of 
        money creation is a social and political question, not merely an economic 
        one based on a superficial and facile statement such as the view of many 
        economists that &#8216;consumer choice is the only mechanism of democracy&#8217;. 
        Currently the commercial sector decides how money can be made (and lost! 
        Enron simply lost $40 billion &#8211; where did it go!). The ever increasing 
        debt burden is now being pushed onto the young and the elderly in the 
        form of student loans and equity release. Yet our future cannot be secured 
        in money terms, money is an &#8216;illusion&#8217;, it is not real wealth: 
        it has no real value of itself, it simply provides the possessor with 
        a &#8216;claim&#8217; to wealth. The cooperative movement is a socially 
        minded trading system which used to be very strong and could be rebuilt, 
        but it has been lost to a great extent to capitalism. We need to re-ground 
        ourselves in the really important aspects of society and re-examine the 
        role of the social and public sectors, and our money systems need to be 
        reformed to reflect these deeper values.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Michael Linton</span> explained the possibility 
        of creating &#8216;virtual&#8217; local currencies in terms of a &#8216;multiple 
        money system&#8217;: Open Money. Currently as money moves around, it tends 
        to always move away, as a result of the current economic paradigm. Yet 
        in a virtual money system trading with &#8216;imaginary&#8217; money, 
        the money comes back, it circulates within the &#8216;community&#8217;. 
        People belong to many &#8216;local&#8217; networks related to their activities 
        and interests such as sports, the arts etc. Each &#8216;type&#8217; of 
        network can have its own currency and this need not be limited to a geographical 
        area, but can also represent a kind of activity. The system operates as 
        follows:<br>
        1. Businesses need to be willing to &#8216;create&#8217; and then to donate 
        &#8216;community way&#8217; currency (ie open money) to &#8216;local&#8217; 
        community service groups such as schools and other local charities and/or 
        services which need funding. The business must then be willing to accept 
        the community way currency in exchange for goods and services, however 
        they are not obliged to take the full price of any particular item in 
        local currency and may have a system whereby say 20% of a transaction 
        value (eg a meal in a restaurant) is paid in open money and the balance 
        in hard cash (ie the normal currency such as pounds sterling) as usual. 
        <br>
        2. The community service organisation then &#8216;spends&#8217; the local 
        currency into circulation. This is done both by exchange for a service 
        or product from other users of the community way currency and also by 
        means of exchanging &#8216;hard cash&#8217; for the local currency when 
        an individual/organisation donates money to the local charity or service. 
        In this way both parties benefit and those who donate &#8216;hard cash&#8217; 
        to local services receive in exchange the same amount in the local currency 
        (exchange rate should always remain 1 to 1), which they can then spend 
        in one of the local businesses which created the money.<br>
        3. People need to be willing to make exchanges within the local community/network, 
        in the local currency.<br>
        4. A Community group is required such as London Open Money, which provides 
        a roster of organisations that need money and manages and administers 
        the &#8216;local&#8217; Open Money system. An open money card is proved 
        to the users in which the transaction information is stored.<br>
        In this way an additional way of exchanging goods and services is created 
        in any type of &#8216;local community&#8217; in which the &#8216;money&#8217; 
        always circulates within the system and is thus never &#8216;lost&#8217; 
        to an &#8216;absentee&#8217; power structure. </p>
      <p>        The general consensus from the talks and from questions from the floor 
        indicated that the present crisis provides a fairly unique opportunity 
        for reforms since change can occur when the dominant groups lose confidence. 
        But pressure will be required to make the best use of this situation. 
        The need is to shift the emphasis from the private sector reaping the 
        rewards from money systems, to allowing the public sector to be funded 
        from money supply, which in turn would reduce the need for taxation.<br>
