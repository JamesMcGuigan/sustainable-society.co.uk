        'Sustainable' is a buzz word of our times. But what really is 
sustainable? What way of life? What systems? What care for ourselves and 
the world around us will ensure that we all have a future? This event 
highlights some of the key questions - and the thought provoking answers.

      <p>&#8216;CONVERGENCE &amp; ACCOMODATION&#8217; AS ANTIDOTES TO GROWTH &amp; 
        CONSUMERISM </p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Teresa Hale</span> introduced the meeting explaining 
        that the current model of medicine which treats symptoms rather than seeking 
        out the causes of disease is inherently flawed. The NHS was set up to 
        try to ensure that the costs of medical treatment declined, but although 
        improvements have occurred in some areas, diseases such as sugar diabetes 
        is increasing, as well as childhood asthma, and it is predicted that 1 
        in 2 people will suffer from cancer. The pharmaceutical industry also 
        concentrates on treating symptoms and alarmingly the side effects of medicines 
        is the fourth greatest killer in both the US and the UK, after cancer 
        and heart disease. Litigation against pharmaceutical companies in the 
        US has become so frequent that legislation limiting such litigation is 
        currently being enacted by the Bush administration. To try to combat these 
        problems some suggestions were made, such as contracts with pharmaceutical 
        companies to encourage them to provide cost effective treatments and cures 
        which could help to shift the emphasis from costly treatments for long 
        term symptoms to cures for disease. Taxation on foods such as sugar was 
        also suggested as a preventative remedy to the many diseases which are 
        caused by excess sugar in the diet.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Moyra Bremner</span> described the use of chemicals 
        in agriculture and the enormous looming crisis in soil and water within 
        the next 20 to 30 years. &#8216;Sustainability&#8217; and &#8216;organic&#8217; 
        are vague terms which many see as &#8216;optional extras&#8217;, however 
        the facts reflect the urgency of the problems: 7 out of 10 of the most 
        fertile acres of the world are within 1% of dying; 4 out of 10 waterways 
        are poisoned; the US wheat belt is drying up; children are being born 
        with severe deformities (such as no arms or legs) and are also suffering 
        from chronic mental health problems due to pesticide use (eg in the production 
        of cranberries in the US); the recent drought in the US was caused by 
        dust blown from China due to overuse of sophisticated irrigation methods. 
        Soil is being damaged by chemicals which are designed to kill crop pests, 
        but they attack much more than the &#8216;pests&#8217;. The content of 
        funguses, insects, and vegetation (eg algae) in the soil is far greater 
        than on the surface by a factor of millions. The net effect of the chemicals 
        is to kill almost everything, including the beneficial contents of the 
        soil. For example micro-rhizol fungi which attach to the roots of plants 
        and whose tendrils draw up water and micronutrients which therefore feed 
        the plants, acting as a natural nursemaid, are killed by the chemicals. 
        Furthermore nitrates make the plants more thirsty and thus the chemicals 
        produce a twofold attack. The plants then need irrigation which further 
        damages the soil. Water use has increased many times due to irrigation 
        over the last few decades and soil is being stripped away to end up in 
        the rivers and streams. Ultimately the price of our cheap food is being 
        paid for in the lives of children around the world. The solution is to 
        use only organic production methods, which in fact are far more productive 
        than monocultures, in spite of claims that mass production and use of 
        genetically engineered seeds are necessary to &#8216;feed the world&#8217;.

      <p><span class="speakers">Robin Stott</span> discussed the links between 
        health and sustainability, binding environmental issues into health issues. 
        This depends on economic, environmental and social justice: the three 
        pillars of health and sustainability. Health is a state in which all aspects 
        of the individual are in balance: physical, psychological &amp; spiritual 
        for example. One individual cannot be healthy at the expense of another, 
        nor from excessive use of natural resources. Health is dependent on collectives 
        and networks (more than genes) and a more equitable distribution of power 
        and access to financial &amp; other resources. Convergence and accommodation 
        are principles for sustainable health: for some the ecological footprint 
        needs to contract and for others (eg in developing countries) they could 
        to expand. Our needs should be met and environmental and social justice 
        implemented without endangering future generations or compromising the 
        environment. Thus health and sustainability are central to policy formulation 
        which requires active participation and localisation. Wealth created outside 
        &#8216;convergence and accommodation&#8217; will undermine sustainability 
        and health. Various tools are available to assist this transition: environmental 
        and social impact assessments, creation of virtuous loops and ecological 
        footprints (markers of environmental space).</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Sandra Hill</span> explained that complementary 
        or alternative medicine (holistic medicine) is based on the understanding 
        that &#8216;the whole is greater that the sum of the parts&#8217;. Currently 
        medicine in compartmentalised, it has become fragmented under reductionist 
        theories and practices. Yet the body is a dynamic living system and through 
        the various types of holistic medical practices a map of the energetic 
        patterns of the body can be used to treat the whole body. Thus sustainable 
        health is based on &#8216;wholism&#8217; and complimentary medicine examines 
        the pattern between the parts. In natural systems cycles such as the seasons 
        play a vital role in the dynamic patters of life. In the case of the seasons 
        winter represents stillness; spring: expansion; summer: fruition; autumn: 
        decline. All cycles begin from stillness. The loss of the natural relationships 
        with nature and the cycles has caused a loss of trust in our body&#8217;s 
        ability to heal itself: we need to understand where we need to intervene 
        and what with. This disassociation from nature is leading to insecurity 
        and fear generally. There is also a loss of understanding of death and 
        in our fear we are always seeking something and fall prey to advertising 
        for everything from drugs to insurance. Yet security comes from within 
        and we need to understand and accept that life is precious and mysterious. 
        Through science we have developed a kind of arrogance that we can understand 
        everything, yet in traditional systems the mystery is part of the understanding 
        and prevents us from playing with ecosystems and our bodies. Complexity 
        theory, chaos theory and natural systems theories can help us to come 
        back to this natural understanding of ourselves and our bodies and lead 
        us towards sustainable health.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Helena Norbert-Hodge</span> spoke of the need 
        for economic literacy. Both the environmental and the social crises are 
        mounting and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening in all 
        countries, both in the East and the West. Now terrorism and perpetual 
        war is as serious as global warming and toxins. Yet there is more hope 
        for optimism now than even 10 years ago. In the last 5 years there has 
        been a shift in the understanding of the economic underpinnings of the 
        current global problems. Taxes and government funding is being used to 
        generate &#8216;growth&#8217; which is a measure not of a healthy economy 
        but of environmental and social breakdown. Very large mobile corporations 
        wield the power behind the scenes, yet even within these corporations 
        some earn very little whilst others earn millions of dollars per year. 
        The sometimes vast distances between producers and consumers is a symptom 
        of the economics of &#8216;growth&#8217;. There is a structural link between 
        distances and scale of the monocultures, with food now being sold in &#8216;hypermarkets&#8217;. 
        Yet 50% of the global population still live on the land. The need is to 
        support small-scale local food movements. A grower will receive only around 
        5% of the value of his goods under the globalised economic system yet 
        local producers selling to local consumers may obtain up to 95% more for 
        his produce. Small scale diverse farming is in fact up to 1000 times more 
        productive than the monoculture system. ISEC produce a food toolkit to 
        promote local food movements that can be used by organisations, schools 
        and individuals.</p>
      <p>Questions from the floor indicated the need for political awareness and 
        action as well as media coverage to address the issues described by the 
        panellists. A university lecturer pointed out that in 1992 a government 
        spokesman explained that their view was that there is &#8216;no link between 
        the environment and health&#8217;, except perhaps in the case of toxic 
        fumes from traffic. Governments need a serious &#8216;reality check&#8217; 
        and to examine the effects of perpetual economic growth, which cannot 
        be infinite with finite resources. <br>
