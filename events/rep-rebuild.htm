<h2 align="center">REBUILDING LOCAL ECONOMIES:<BR>From theory to practice</h2>
<p align="center">Report by <span class="speakers">Leonie Humphreys</span></p>
<p align="center">London School of Economics<br>
  3rd March 2003</p>
<p><span class="speakers">Patrick Holden</span>, Director, Soil Association<br>
  <span class="speakers">Pat Conaty</span>, New Economics Foundation<br>
  <span class="speakers">Naomi Kingsley</span>, Chief Executive, London Rebuilding 
  Society<br>
  <span class="speakers">Chris Dunham</span>, Sustainable Energy Action<br>
  Chair: <span class="speakers">Herbie Girardet</span>, Chairman, Schumacher Society</p>
<p><span class="speakers">Herbie Girardet</span> introduced the meeting explaining 
  that globalisation is leading to the destruction of local economies. Companies 
  relocating to areas where wages are cheap, such as Dyson&#8217;s move from Somerset 
  to Malaysia. However many organisations such as Soil Association, Schumacher 
  Society, ISEC, NEF and London Rebuilding Society are working to strengthen local 
  economies.</p>
<p><span class="speakers">Patrick Holden</span> explained that re-localisation 
  should not be a &#8216;fringe&#8217; activity, but central to a new economics. 
  The state of farming has reached rock bottom. The whole process of strengthening 
  local economies requires a spiritual and cultural dimension. Food is a fundamental 
  and crucial indicator of the whole process of the breakdown of local economies. 
  For example trace elements and minerals essential to proper growth have declined 
  by 50-70% over the last few decades and children today are far more likely to 
  suffer from diseases due to the reduction in quality of our food, through use 
  of pesticides etc, and now genetically engineered products. Even the organic 
  market is now being globalised and the quality is suffering. Suggestions for 
  improvement include Fair Trade/Organic food schemes to provide both a social 
  and environmental dimension and city food programmes where people produce their 
  own food within cities is also being promoted by the Soil Association, amongst 
  other programmes. </p>
<p><span class="speakers">Pat Conaty </span>described the process of taking the 
  theory of &#8216;human scale economics&#8217; into practice. The NEF have recently 
  published a report &#8216;Ghost Town Britain&#8217; which outlines the problems 
  of the destruction of local economies. Since the BSE and &#8216;foot and mouth&#8217; 
  crises the average income of farmers in the UK has been severely reduced from 
  around &pound;8,000 after BSE to around &pound;4,000 after &#8216;foot and mouth&#8217; 
  and 11 farms are going bankrupt per day in the UK. Reform is required at many 
  levels and sectors, for example: corporations, banking, land, energy and money. 
  The NEF works with people to provide credit where banks will not help and to 
  set up Community Land Trusts which allow the land value to be taken out of the 
  cost of living. </p>
<p><span class="speakers">Naomi Kingsley</span> explained that the London Rebuilding 
  Society provide Community Development Finance which is relatively new in the 
  UK. They tackle exclusion, sustainability and renewal in a proactive way. They 
  operate in such a way as to develop relationships and trust in local communities, 
  offering advice, support and training. </p>
<p><span class="speakers">Chris Dunham </span>described the activities of Sustainable 
  Energy Action which is a &#8216;not for profit&#8217; organisation which advises 
  on reducing CO2 emissions. In London for example there is very little use of 
  photo-voltaics as an energy source. The planning system needs to be reformed 
  to encourage rather than discourage use of renewable energy supplies. They are 
  working to install solar energy in schools in London whilst combining this with 
  the school curriculum to educate at the same time as provide a practical shift 
  in energy use. Useful websites are: <a href="http://www.london21.org">www.london21.org</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.lsx.org">www.lsx.org</a>.</p>
<p><span class="orgs">&quot;Creating a Sustainable Society&quot;</span> is a series 
  of events that takes place monthly in London. The aim of the initiative is to 
  create a synergy among people and organisations working towards a better society 
  but in different fields.<br>
