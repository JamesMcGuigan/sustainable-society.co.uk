      <span class="orangered">Richard Murphy</span> is an economics graduate 

        and chartered accountant. He trained with what is now KPMG before starting 

        his own firm at the age of 26. This grew to have three partners and eight 

        hundred clients before he and his partners sold it in 2000 to concentrate 

        on other activities. He has also been chairman, chief executive or finance 

        director of nine SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) over the last 15 

        years and continues his active involvement in the commercial economy at 

        present. <br><br>

		Richard has written on taxation and accounting matters for many 

        years, both within the profession and now as a regular contributor to 

        the Observer. <br><br>

		He campaigned for Oxfam in the 1980s and has been involved 

        in new economics in some way since the first TOES (The Other Economic 

        Summit). He now campaigns on reform in three areas: international tax, 

        pensions and the money supply. He created the economic thinking behind 

        the "People's Pensions" report published in 2003 and wrote most of the 

        Briefing Document for Early Day Motion 854. He is currently undertaking 

        work on the economics of extortionate lending for the New Economics Foundation, 

        Church Action on Poverty and the Debt on the Doorstep Campaign.<br>
