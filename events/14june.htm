In addition to these speakers, there will be one or two surprise guests to contribute to the event. 









<H3 class="heading2">THE LECTURES </H3>





The first London Lectures will explore how improved information flow between government, business, and civil-society can enhance the implementation of sustainable development. Earth Summit 2002 will, above all else, seek to define new ways of producing tangible solutions - nationally and internationally -  to the key environmental problems of our time. 

	<UL> 

	<LI>

	Global warming.

	</LI>

	<LI>

	The loss of biodiversity.

	</LI>

	<LI>

	A decline in environmental security.

		</LI>

	</UL>







All these topics present stakeholders with problems that they cannot solve alone. How then can we ensure that politicians, business leaders, and the public see sustainability as central to our way of life and the implementation of future social objectives? <BR>



The focus of the Lectures is the UN Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. The Lectures and the question-and-answer sessions will explore what government and business is doing to implement sustainable development. 



	<UL> 

		<LI>



 		Can available knowledge on this be used more effectively in national

governance, and in the management of companies and public bodies?

		</LI>

		<LI>

		How can improved information flows between politicians, business and society at large enhance the implementation of sustainable development?

		</LI>

		<LI>

		How can new perspectives on governance and management contribute to world-wide sustainability?

		</LI>

	</UL>





<SPAN STYLE="color: FireBrick">The London Schumacher Lectures </SPAN> will allow an audience of 400 people to listen to and enter a debate with six or more high level speakers in an afternoon and early evening event. We want to explore how we can bring the theme of 'sustainability' centre stage into decision making by politicians, business leaders, opinion formers and the general public. 



<P>



<H3 class="heading3">THE SCHUMACHER LECTURES </H3>





Since 1979 Schumacher Lectures have been held at major venues in Bristol. They have been dubbed 'the UK's premier environmental gathering' by the Guardian. Since 1996 Schumacher Lectures have also been held in Liverpool and Manchester, and since 2001 in Edinburgh and Dublin. From 2001 the annual London Schumacher Lectures will augment the programme of conferences and events organised by UNED Forum and the Schumacher Society in this joint initiative in London.

The event will consist of two afternoon sessions, 2:30 to 4:30 and 5:30 to 7:30 PM. Each session will include short lectures followed by a period of questions and answers.
