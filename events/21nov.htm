Open Meeting, House of Lords, 21 November 2001





<H2 class="titles">Public Government Spending and Interest-Free Banking - Practical

Solutions to Monetary Problems</H2>





Speaker: <SPAN STYLE="color: OrangeRed">Richard Douthwaite</SPAN><br>





Public spending in excess of public revenue does NOT necessarily mean a

public borrowing requirement. If the government spent money into

circulation

rather than leaving it to commercial banks to create, it would not only

make

more public capital projects possible but it would also make the economic

system far more stable. This is because the money supply would not

disappear

when a worried public ceased to borrow for consumption and businesses

ceased

to borrow to invest. The looming global depression will be exacerbated by a

sharp decline in the money stock, rather than moderated by there still

being

a lot of money about.<br>



<SPAN STYLE="color: OrangeRed">Douthwaite</SPAN> will also discuss the role that money created on the basis of

debt plays in generating the growth compulsion of the current economic

system and the extent to which interest-free banking would reduce this.<br><p>



<SPAN STYLE="color: OrangeRed">Richard Douthwaite</SPAN> is an economist and writer who has published <SPAN STYLE="color: DarkOrange">The Growth

Illusion, The Ecology of Money, Short Circuit</SPAN>. <br>

He lives in the West of

Ireland and has co-founded <SPAN STYLE="color: FireBrick">FEASTA the Foundation for the Economics of

Sustainability</SPAN>, which is currently developing plans for an interest-free

bank.
