In its first term in office, the New Labour government has taken a fundamental first step towards tax reform based on the principle of sustainable development. About nine percent of the total revenue now comes from green taxes. Britain will have had three major tax shift programmes by mid-2002. However, Britain cannot afford to be complacent.<br>
 
Our tax system still overwhelmingly encourages economic development that causes long-term and often irreversible environmental damage and fails to provide sufficient jobs, while the gap between the richest and the poorest ten percent is as great as it was a hundred years ago.<br>
 
The Progressive Forum has recently completed a report that explores how to bring the debate on sustainable taxation forward, with a particular emphasis on land-value taxation. The principle conclusions were drawn from the seminar on Sustainable Taxation held in April last year and the interviews with key figures involved in this policy field earlier in the year.<br> 
 
They are:<ul>
 
<li>	Keep the momentum going through the establishment of a Citizens Sustainable Tax Commission</li>
<li>	Adopt the term sustainable tax reform instead of environmental tax reform</li>
<li>	Place land value taxation higher up the
sustainable taxation agenda.</li>
	</ul>
 
The seminar aims to bring together those people who want to help ensure further developments towards sustainable taxation and discuss the way forward based on the report, as well as provide a forum for critics to express their views.<br>
