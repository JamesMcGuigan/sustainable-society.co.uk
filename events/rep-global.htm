        The challenges currently facing humanity are historically unique, both 
        in their global reach and their long-term consequences. Yet decisions 
        are taken by an elite few whose actions are in sharp contrast with the 
        best interests of humanity. The widening gap between our deeper values 
        and current policies threatens the legitimacy of our democratic system. 
        We need a new vision of global governance.</h3>

        <span class="orgs">Jubilee Research</span><br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Ann Pettifor</span> introduced the meeting, on 
        the eve of war with Iraq, thanking the audience for attending this discussion 
        of issues beyond the war and explaining the need for a more stable and 
        fair global economy. The work of Jubilee 2000 focuses on global financial 
        governance and the relationship between international creditors and sovereign 
        debtors.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Derek Osborn</span> reminded us that in spite 
        of the war with Iraq, Tony Blair has spoken of the need for long-term 
        sustainability. The failure of the United Nations is due to the collective 
        failure of the individual nations since it has no powers of its own; hence 
        when consensus breaks down the role of the UN is destroyed, as has recently 
        been witnessed. He emphasised the need for a new international consensus 
        between nations and for &#8216;instrumentalism&#8217;. For example initiatives 
        such as the Kyoto Protocol could (in spite of the USA&#8217;s refusal 
        to commit to it) nevertheless be pushed forward by other nations: partial 
        action is necessary to progress. Sustainable development presents a conundrum: 
        it is obvious yet elusive. Core values need to guide both public and private 
        practices. The Human Rights Carter and the Earth Charter represent such 
        values at the human level. Strategies are needed at national level, led 
        by heads and centres of governments with support from economic and financial 
        departments, using indicators, measures and economic instruments. Poverty 
        is a pressing issue and interconnected common solutions to global problems 
        are required, such as Agenda 21 which has been of some use, but lacked 
        focus. There are some signs of monitoring mechanisms beginning and the 
        need is for slow, steady incremental changes, moving towards sustainability. 
      </p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Jakob von Uexkull</span> explained the purpose 
        of the World Future Council initiative. It is not intended to be another 
        NGO, but a Council of the wise, pioneers, hero&#8217;s and youth leaders, 
        linking also with the e-parliament. Around 20 working groups will be set 
        up with funding potentially on an individual basis. This new initiative 
        is intended due to the difficulties of reforming other existing global 
        institutions, which tend to be captive to current ideologies. It is not 
        to provide any &#8216;new ethics&#8217; since humanity does hold common 
        values such as love, generosity and solidarity/cooperation. However, these 
        tend to go against the current economic and political paradigm, so the 
        WFC will &#8216;fill the gap&#8217;, speaking for these common values. 
        There is widespread trust for certain individuals such as Nelson Mandela 
        and H.H. the XIV Dalai Lama of Tibet and there are many others not so 
        well known, but it is not anticipated that selection of members of the 
        Council will be problematic. The LSE may like to become a partner for 
        one of the working groups.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">Heikki Patomaki</span> spoke of various issues, 
        which are in need of reform, such as human rights, gender issues and land 
        reform. Democracy could provide the framework and a strategy is required 
        for global democracy. Some institutions could be reformed such as the 
        United Nations and the World Trade Organisation. New institutions could 
        be established such as a global lottery, global justice, global truth 
        and a people&#8217;s parliament. Global civil society will need to provide 
        the force for change. The work of NIGD concentrates on financial reform 
        since institutions such as the World Bank and IMF control 80 nation states. 
        In order to relieve financial dependency, provide autonomy and empower 
        resources for the global common good NIGD support debt arbitration and 
        a currency tax (the Tobin tax). The WTO is non democratic and radical 
        and should be reformed so as to provide an opt-out mechanism, GATT rules 
        should only be for LDC&#8217;s and GATS should be cancelled or renegotiated, 
        whilst intellectual property rights should be handed back to the UN. The 
        Currency Transaction Tax Organisation are planning an international conference 
        which should be led by countries in the global South through financial 
        and moral support and by their attendance. This conference may be hosted 
        by either Brazil or India.</p>
      <p><span class="speakers">John Jopling</span> explained the work of the 
        Worldwide Democracy Network (WDN). The current system of global governance 
        is resistant to social justice, environmental protection and economic 
        competence. Hence the WDN is a new system designed to allow global transformation 
        to sustainable lifestyles. 100 co-learners are currently engaged in this 
        systems change to provide a global network of Gaian democracies. The WDN 
        seeks to imitate nature&#8217;s organisation, applying it to human governance 
        through such systems as &#8216;nested self-organisation&#8217;. The aim 
        is to provide a system of global governance to which people can contribute. 
        The motivation and the tools are available and there is a growing awareness 
        that we are a single human family/society. In other words social justice 
        and sustainability are not single issues anymore, they are understood 
        as &#8216;universal human values&#8217;. Yet our governments are not representing 
        these values. There is currently a crisis of human identity, with the 
        West living off others and future generations, which have become dehumanising 
        to such an extent we no longer have any choice, we must change.</p>
      <p>Questions from the floor concerned issues of spirituality, human values 
        and harmony between humanity and nature as well as each other, definitions 
        of &#8216;social justice&#8217;, concerns regarding resistance to change 
        and the current domination of the USA in general on the global community. 
        The general response to which was that humanity has reached a point where 
        &#8216;moral power&#8217; will become the new global authority, founded 
        on common human values and pushed ahead through a global citizens force 
        for transformation, through various mechanisms such as those discussed.
