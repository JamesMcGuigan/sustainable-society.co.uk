    <TD><h2><span class="heading1">Media Empires</span></h2>
       by <strong>Serge Halimi</strong>
      <p><br>
        These days, one thing seems to surprise us: the lack of independence of 
        the fabled Fourth Estate . Even the very rightwing French TV network, 
        TF1, not known for its independence, had its news director state: &#8220;Today, 
        those famous US networks we heard so much about as examples of professional 
        integrity are acting like propaganda tools for the Bush administration. 
        They have lost all critical distance from that crisis .&#8221; </p>
      <p>What has happened to the US media did not start with George W Bush. And 
        it has also happened elsewhere. Let me begin with a quote. &#8220;One 
        of our best-kept secrets is the degree to which a handful of huge corporations 
        control the flow of information in the United States. Whether it is television, 
        radio, newspapers, magazines, books or the internet, a few giant conglomerates 
        are determining what we see, hear and read. And the situation is likely 
        to become much worse .&#8220; You can dismiss that quote: after all it 
        comes from Bernie Sanders, one of the most progressive members of the 
        US House of Representatives. </p>
      <p>But, as a matter of record, in 1983 the US had roughly 1,700 daily newspapers, 
        11,000 magazines, 9,000 radio and 1,000 television stations, and 2,500 
        book publishers. But at that time only 50 multinationals, all &#8220;interlocked 
        in common financial interest with other massive industries and with a 
        few dominant international banks,&#8221; controlled the majority of the 
        big outlets. Clearly, something had to be done. So it was. But not what 
        you would logically expect. </p>
      <p>In 1996 the US Congress, which had just cut federal aid to the poor, 
        granted frequencies worth some $70bn at that time (and a lot more now) 
        at no cost to the recipients. <br>
        Viacom, Disney and General Electric &#8211; the respective owners of the 
        CBS, ABC and NBC networks -- were the main beneficiaries of the decision. 
        Protesting the gift, Senator John McCain, a Republican, made the following 
        statement during the congressional debate: &#8220;There will be hardly 
        any talk of this decision on radio or TV because the radio and TV networks 
        are the ones directly affected&#8221;. </p>
      <p>In fact during the nine months that elapsed between the introduction 
        of the legislation and its final approval, the three main news networks 
        devoted just 19 minutes to the subject. The question of whether the largest 
        communications companies could afford to pay for the frequencies that 
        the US government awarded them was not raised at all.</p>
      <p>There is always a payoff for bad deeds: between 1996 and 2000, while 
        Bill Clinton was president, the 50 largest media corporations and four 
        of their trade associations spent over $111 million to lobby Congress 
        and the White House. In other words, they poured political contributions 
        into the coffers of the two political parties. And, as everyone knows, 
        in the very corrupt US system of political financing, &#8220;those who 
        sign the checks write the laws&#8221;. </p>
      <p>Since the 1980s control of the media has grown ever more concentrated. 
        This year, ten giant companies reign over the information age. Back in 
        1996, the two largest radio chains owned 115 stations. Today, those two 
        own more than 1,400. Meanwhile the number of station owners has dwindled 
        by a third. Clearly, something has to be done now. And it will be. But, 
        again, not what you would logically expect.</p>
      <p>According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which largely 
        determines US media policy, the trouble is that large conglomerates are 
        too restricted by legal limits on market share. The solution, then, is 
        sweeping deregulation of the field.</p>
      <p>A US Federal Court has ordered the Federal Communications Commission 
        to reconsider its rule preventing broadcasters from reaching more than 
        35% of households in the United States. And since everyone knows that 
        FCC chairman Michael Powell, appointed by President Bush and the son of 
        Secretary of State Colin Powell, opposes such limits, the court order 
        will encourage big broadcasters to swallow smaller ones. </p>
      <p>The FCC is &#8220;reconsidering&#8221; many of the rules that have preserved 
        some media diversity, such as the regulation preventing the owners of 
        a broadcast station from buying a newspaper in the same city, and vice 
        versa, or from owning more than one TV station in the same market. This 
        newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership ban guarantees that communities will 
        not find that their only local daily paper has been bought by one of the 
        TV networks. Also at stake is the regulation barring major TV networks 
        &#8211; ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC &#8211; from merging with each other.</p>
      <p>Michael Powell keeps repeating: &#8220;The market is my religion,&#8221; 
        nicely summing up the mindset of this Bush administration which has successfully 
        merged religious fundamentalism and unleashed greed. Moreover the lack 
        of political diversity hardly bothers Powell: &#8220;I'm not so sure that 
        Disney and Murdoch&#8217;s personal political interests are ever permitted 
        by the board of directors or Wall Street to trump anything that would 
        maximize value .&#8221; The fact that maximising value may amount to an 
        ideological slant of sorts hardly seems to have crossed the FCC chairman&#8217;s 
        mind. </p>
      <p>And what do conglomerates say on the matter? Companies such as News Corporation 
        and Viacom are protesting that existing regulations deprive them of their 
        First Amendment rights to free speech. The rollback of some of the last 
        regulatory checks on media consolidation appears very likely, therefore. 
        A further drop in news quality and original content will be likely if 
        newspapers were to be absorbed by the broadcast TV industry.</p>
      <p>As we speak, mergers and cooperation between former competitors multiply: 
        The Washington Post, which lost regular foreign distribution of its stories 
        because of the New York Times' forced buyout of The Post's stake in the 
        International Herald Tribune, will have have its stories appear in the 
        European and Asian editions of the Wall Street Journal. The Post has a 
        similar arrangement with NBC, which features Post reporting on its MSNBC 
        and CNBC cable television channels . These days, it is hard to say which 
        outlet, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post or NBC, is the most 
        hawkish. </p>
      <p>&#8216;You want diversity? Go online!&#8217;</p>
      <p>The FCC argues that technologies like the internet offer Americans access 
        to more information than ever and thus worries about monopolies are unfounded. 
        But studies also show that most Americans receive their news from a handful 
        of outlets. Beyond this, much of what appears on the internet is repackaged 
        from those outlets. The leading 20 internet sites and biggest cable channels 
        are owned by GE-NBC, Disney, Fox, Gannett, AOL Time Warner, Hearst, Microsoft, 
        Cox, Dow Jones, The Washington Post and The New York Times. In 1999, 110 
        companies attracted 60% of the time web users spent online; by 2001, 14 
        companies had taken the same market share .</p>
      <p>The question of concentration is most acute at the local level. In many 
        communities, the vast range of activities is covered by only one institution. 
        . State communism may be dead, but corporate communism is flourishing 
        in the US. Companies that own multiple platforms (print, television, radio, 
        and internet) in the same city are integrating their news production process, 
        using do-it-all journalists to create content for many media at once . 
        The new work regime often undermines a paper&#8217;s capacity to meet 
        its own standards. As Columbia journalism professor John Pavlik reports, 
        &#8220;people are putting in sixteen to twenty-hour days and getting burned 
        out&#8221; as they do several jobs at once. And because of meagre press 
        coverage, most people probably have no idea what is taking place.</p>
      <p>What are the consequences of this? Let me quote again, but this time 
        from a Republican columnist. William Safire. He does not write for Le 
        Monde diplomatique. He was a strong pro-Reagan type and is now very much 
        pro-Bush, except on questions of civil liberties. &#8220;You won't find 
        a movie nominated for an Oscar with the heroine &#8211; fighting to expose 
        the dominance of media conglomerates in the distribution of entertainment 
        &#8211; crushed by the giant corporation that controls film financing, 
        distribution and media criticism.</p>
      <p>&#8220;You won't find television magazine programs fearlessly exposing 
        the broadcast lobby's pressure on Congress and the courts to allow station 
        owners to gobble up more stations and cross-own local newspapers, thereby 
        to determine what information residents of a local market receive. Nor 
        will you find many newspaper chains assigning reporters to reveal the 
        effect of media gigantism on local coverage or cover the way publishers 
        induce coverage-hungry politicians to loosen antitrust restraints .&#8221;</p>
      <p>The media barons </p>
      <p>We seem to know better where increased competition led the American public, 
        or so we were told. Truly independent coverage of the big media is disappearing. 
        Television is where most Americans get their &#8220;news&#8221;. Well, 
        without exception, every major network is owned by a huge conglomerate 
        that has enormous conflicts of interest. Fox News Channel is owned by 
        Rupert Murdoch, a rightwing Australian who already owns a significant 
        portion of the world's media. His network has close ties to the Republican 
        Party, and among his &quot;fair and balanced&quot; commentators is Newt 
        Gingrich, former Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives 
        and current war hawk regarding Iraq .<br>
        NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the largest corporations in the 
        world &#8211; and one with a long history of anti-union activity. GE, 
        a major contributor to the Republican Party, has substantial financial 
        interests in weapons manufacturing, finance, nuclear power and many other 
        industries. Former CEO Jack Welch was one of the leaders in shutting down 
        American plants and moving them to low-wage countries like China and Mexico. 
        NBC is also the company which used Ronald Reagan as a salesman for corporate 
        values in 1954 and for several years after that. He made so much money 
        out of this that this is how and when he became enraged at taxes.<br>
        <br>
        ABC is owned by the Disney Corp., which produces toys and products in 
        developing countries where they provide their workers atrocious wages 
        and working conditions. CBS is owned by Viacom, another huge media conglomerate 
        that owns, among other entities, MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon, VH1, TNN, 
        CMT, 39 broadcast television stations, 184 radio stations, Paramount Pictures 
        and Blockbuster Inc .</p>
      <p>A danger of concentrated ownership is that news organisations embedded 
        in large conglomerates will promote their own products or fail to critically 
        investigate their vested interests. Communications scholars have already 
        discovered emerging evidence of a &#8220;synergy bias&#8221; inside conglomerates. 
        Moreover, now that most American news companies are governed by MBAs, 
        responsibilities to share holders and concerns about stock value are driving 
        the reorganisation of media enterprises, often despite the protest of 
        editors and producers . </p>
      <p>But when news becomes just another commodity, the distinctions between 
        journalistic products &#8211; information, entertainment, infotainment, 
        etc &#8211; lose their significance, as do substantive reports.</p>
      <p>A well-publicised synergy collision happened in 1997 at CBS News when 
        reporters were spotted wearing the Nike &quot;swoosh&quot; at the Olympics, 
        the unfortunate outgrowth of a lucrative financial deal between CBS Sports 
        and Nike. At about the same time a CBS investigator was facing delays 
        in her article on Nike's labour practices . </p>
      <p>Vertical integration of news and entertainment organisations goes along 
        with unreliable reporting. With consolidation, the balance of power is 
        firmly in the hands of a small number of companies with interests and 
        investments spread across the media landscape . A small number of companies 
        more interested in delivering viewers to advertisers than in serving the 
        needs of the public. </p>
      <p> Parochialism and mediocrity </p>
      <p>Similarly, foreign policy coverage has been taking a hit for the last 
        fifteen years. Before September 11, The Boston Globe explained: &quot;International 
        news coverage in most of America's 1,500 mainstream papers has almost 
        reached the vanishing point&#8221;. Foreign stories that accounted for 
        about 10% of the average newspaper's news content in 1972 have shrunk 
        to less than 2%. News magazines have followed the downward trend. In the 
        10 years from 1985 to 1995, Time, Newsweek and US News and World Report 
        cut their foreign reporting from about 22% of the magazine to about 12% 
        Asked why, editors explain that foreign news is &quot;less urgent.&quot; 
        (Time), &quot;less relevant,&quot; (US News) and mean a 25% drop in newsstand 
        sales (Newsweek). The same trend is at work in network television news. 
        Ten years ago, 40% of the three networks' news programs were devoted to 
        foreign news. The figure has slipped below 12% &#8221; </p>
      <p>This has consequences: according to a poll made public by Fox News three 
        years ago, 40% of Americans said they were not sure whether the US or 
        Slobodan Milosevic had won the war in Kosovo. That was in 2000, the year 
        after the war had taken place . And as we speak, 35% to 40% of Americans 
        believe Saddam Hussein had something to do with September 11th. Moreover, 
        even when news organisations do cover foreign events, they tend to rely 
        on a very narrow spectrum of local specialists, often speaking English 
        and drawn from the business sector .</p>
      <p>September11th and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have barely changed 
        things in this regard. Foreign policy coverage remains very marginal according 
        to the last study published by the Columbia Journalism Review, trailing 
        far behind local crime stories and celebrity news. The marketing bias 
        is so overwhelming that even when journalists know that diplomatic news 
        matter a lot more than the latest neighbourhood burglary, they cannot 
        keep their hands off details of the latter even at the cost of overlooking 
        the former.<br>
        <br>
        And things are hardly better on the home front. The US has just undergone 
        some of the biggest business scandals in its history, in part because 
        of the extreme lack of curiosity of most journalists. In 2001, CEO Gerald 
        Levin was on the cover of Fortune (a magazine owned by AOL-Time Warner), 
        praised as &quot;among the smartest people we know.&quot; Ten weeks later, 
        the merger he had engineered was a disaster area. </p>
      <p> The Enron Journalists</p>
      <p>It is true that some star journalists, who were financially profiting 
        from the stock market bubble, had little reason to challenge its long-term 
        viability. Moreover, luminaries of the profession have lined their pockets 
        with corporate honoraria: David Brinkley, Robert Novak, David Gergen, 
        Cokie Roberts, Christopher Matthews, Larry King, Mark Shields, Fred Barnes, 
        George Will and Michael Kinsley, who memorably said &#8220;I didn't do 
        it for years, but it became more socially acceptable .&#8221; New York 
        Times columnist Paul Krugman, who got $50,000 from an Enron advisory board 
        before joining the Times, blamed the criticism on an &#8220;effort by 
        conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for this line of argument, most of the Enron journalists 
        are free-market apologists on the right. Wall Street Journal columnist 
        and Bush fanatic Peggy Noonan received $25,000 to $50,000 for speechwriting 
        help. Lawrence Kudlow of CNBC and National Review said that he should 
        have disclosed earlier that he'd got $50,000 for consulting and research. 
        Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, received $100,000 from the advisory 
        board, and sees nothing wrong with such work . A Weekly Standard piece 
        by another Enron beneficiary, praised Lay and Enron for &quot;leading 
        the fight for competition.&quot; </p>
      <p>As Eric Klinenberg and Tom Frank have pointed out, among others, one 
        &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; fast company after the next has crashed amidst 
        reports of greed, deception, and illegal accounting &#8211; and workers 
        watched their retirement funds dwindle &#8211; Americans have reasons 
        to wonder about the type of reporting they got from big media on these 
        matters. <br>
        Radio stations sound no different &#8211; playing the same programs and 
        using the same formats &#8211; throughout the vast country. To such a 
        point that &#8220; at the moment that Americans are learning to embrace 
        multiculturalism, a monoculture of mainstream material is taking over 
        the airwaves .&#8221; </p>
      <p>Actually, it is even worse than that: corporate radio is just plain overt 
        in its rightwing bias. There are dozens of rightwing talk show programmes. 
        Rush Limbaugh, G Gordon Liddy, Bob Grant, Michael Savage, Michael Reagan, 
        Pat Robertson, to name only a few of the voices that pound a rightwing 
        drumbeat into the heartland of the United States .</p>
      <p>Since its 1996 launch, Fox has become a central hub of the conservative 
        movement's well-oiled media machine. Together with the Republican Party 
        and its satellite think tanks and advocacy groups, this network of fiercely 
        partisan outlets &#8211; such as the Washington Times, the Wall Street 
        Journal editorial page and conservative talk-radio shows like Rush Limbaugh's--forms 
        an effective rightwing echo chamber where Republican-friendly news stories 
        can be promoted, repeated and amplified. Fox knows how to play this game 
        better than anyone . </p>
      <p>Fox's founder and president, Roger Ailes, was for decades one of the 
        savviest and most pugnacious Republican political operatives in Washington, 
        a veteran of the Nixon and Reagan campaigns. Ailes is most famous for 
        his role in crafting the elder Bush's media strategy in the 1988 presidential 
        race featuring a black convict, Willie Horton, who had raped a white woman 
        after he had been paroled by Massachusetts governor Democratic presidential 
        candidate Michael Dukakis. Fox's managing editor is Brit Hume, a veteran 
        TV journalist and contributor to the conservative American Spectator and 
        Weekly Standard magazines. A special about foreign policy used to be hosted 
        by Newt Gingrich. </p>
      <p>Even public television is taken in that trend. Last year, PBS has broadcast 
        a six-hour series about the global economy which was sponsored by major 
        corporations &#8211; including Enron &#8211; that have a clear interest 
        in the show's content. The series has received a rave review from the 
        Wall Street Journal (28 March 2002) under the headline &quot;PBS Likes 
        Capitalism More Than the Commercial Networks Do,&quot; in which the Journal 
        hailed the series as a &quot;paean to private enterprise&quot; </p>
      <p>But, as Bernie Sanders has argued, &#8220;the essential problem with 
        television is not just a right-wing bias in news and programming, it is 
        not even the transformation of politics and government into entertainment 
        and sensationalism, the constant bombardment of advertising. It's that 
        the most important issues facing the middle-class and working people are 
        rarely discussed.&#8221; </p>
      <p>And he cites the facts that despite the great &quot;economic boom&quot; 
        of the 1990s, the average American worker is now working longer hours 
        for lower wages than 30 years ago. Those subjects are rarely the staple 
        of television investigations. Workers who are in unions earn 30% more 
        than non-union people doing the same work. There are a lot of programs 
        on television about how to get rich by investing in the stock market. 
        But never any &quot;specials&quot; on how to go about forming a union? 
      </p>
      <p>To which one may add that the United States has the most unfair distribution 
        of wealth and income in the industrialised world, but few programmes belabour 
        the fact that the richest 1% own more wealth than the bottom 95%. Or that 
        the CEOs of major corporations earn 691 times what their employees make. 
        It was 41 times that much in 1980. </p>
      <p> The War Street Journal ?</p>
      <p>We now know that major US newspapers do not only participate in the promotion 
        of inequality at home. They can also beat the war drum with great effectiveness 
        and become a leading player in the diplomatic game. The point was driven 
        home to us when on Thursday 30 January a story led the Wall Street Journal's 
        front page. Under the headline, &#8220;European Leaders Declare Support 
        for U.S. on Iraq: Letter From Eight Countries Isolates France, Germany, 
        Smooths Path for a War,&quot; the reporter from the paper's London bureau 
        reported: &#8220;In a broad statement supporting the U.S. in its effort 
        to strip Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, eight European leaders signed 
        an op-ed article publicly calling for unity with the U.S. position, further 
        shifting the global political calculus toward support for war.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Most op-ed page articles are solicited by the section's editors. And 
        that was the case with the Journal's statement by the European leaders. 
        In other words, as the Los Angeles Times noted, &#8220;the paper had orchestrated 
        a declaration of support for a Bush administration policy which its own 
        editorial page has unstintingly supported, and then reported the event 
        as news? &#8220;</p>
      <p>According to Wall Street Journal editor Gigot, the unusual op-ed piece 
        originated with an idea by Mike Gonzalez, the deputy editorial editor 
        of the Journal's European edition. &#8220;After the flap about France 
        and Germany opposing the U.S. on Iraq, &raquo; Gigot said, &laquo; Mike 
        acted as a journalist and called the offices of two other heads of state, 
        [Italy's] Silvio Berlusconi and [Spain's] Jose Maria Aznar, offering them 
        the opportunity to do separate pieces on their positions. Aznar's office 
        apparently got the idea that they should see if they could get other prime 
        ministers and heads of state on board. They took it from there and got 
        [Britain's] Tony Blair involved and it all snowballed. At that point, 
        our only concern was to make sure it ran in our paper.&#8221;</p>
      <p>In an editorial, &#8220;The Op-Ed Alliance&#8221;, the Wall Street Journal 
        scarcely claimed journalistic objectivity and proudly acknowledged the 
        political, pro-war role it had played in the matter: &#8220;Our sin seems 
        to be that we assisted in exposing as fraudulent the conventional wisdom 
        that France and Germany speak for all of Europe, and that all of Europe 
        is now anti-American. Those ideas were always false, but they were peddled 
        as true because they served the political purposes of those, both in Europe 
        and America, who oppose President Bush on Iraq. We've been in favor of 
        ousting Saddam Hussein for years, going back to the Gulf War and long 
        before President Bush made it his policy. If the op-ed by Europe's leaders 
        somehow helped Mr. Bush's diplomacy in addition to selling newspapers, 
        that's fine with us .&#8221;</p>
      <p>In the same issue, the deputy director of the Wall Street Journal and 
        the man behind the scoop, Michael Gonzales, spells things out: &#8220;Let's 
        be done with that right away. The Journal is an independent newspaper 
        and doesn't carry water for any government. So here's what happened. About 
        two weeks ago, I placed a call to a source in the Italian government. 
        I asked right away, &quot;So are you going to let the French and the Germans 
        speak for all of Europe? Why doesn't Silvio Berlusconi write us a piece 
        with his views?&#8221; At first, the response was tepid. But then, as 
        Gonzales explains in a fascinating fashion, &#8220;I was at a museum, 
        trying to ease my disappointment with a dose of Breughel and Rubens, when 
        my wife's cellphone rang .&#8221; And the response was favourable. Blair 
        (reached through Alistair Campbell), Aznar and Berlusconi instantly replaced 
        Rubens and Breughel.</p>
      <p>It seems to me two things stand out here. First the link between economic 
        policy and diplomacy. It is probably because of the unstinting editorial 
        support the Wall Street Journal has lent to the economic policies of Berlusconi, 
        Aznar and Blair that this newspaper, highly influential in corporate circles, 
        has gained the extraordinary leverage enabling it to call these European 
        leaders and directly advise policy on other matters, namely war in Iraq. 
        I can hardly imagine any other newspaper in the world, save maybe for 
        the Financial Times, directly lobbying for policies at this high a level 
        in several countries at once. </p>
      <p>The second thing is this. If you want to know the plight of the American 
        press today, just imagine what its reaction might have been if a leftwing, 
        pro-union paper had directly lobbied foreign heads of state toward making 
        a statement opposing US foreign policy.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Propaganda tools for the US administration&#8221; does not seem 
        too harsh a conclusion, from what we see and read coming from the United 
        States these days. <br>
        But it did not start with George W Bush. <br>
