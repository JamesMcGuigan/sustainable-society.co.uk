<H2 class="titles">
Rally for a Sustainable Britain</H2>


A day conference<BR>
Saturday April 6th<BR>
Westminster Central Hall<BR>
London


<SPAN STYLE="color: DarkOrange">Speakers include:</SPAN> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP, Charles Secrett, Bianca Jagger, Sara Parkin, Madeline Bunting, Peter Melchett (tbc) and more.....


While Labour's first term in office delivered some moves towards sustainability, there is a long way to go. SERA believes that Labour's second term must be used to deliver a positive vision of a sustainable Britain. <BR>

A sustainable Britain will require a far more fundamental shift towards industries such as renewable energy, waste recycling and low input agriculture. In a sustainable Britain, certain aspects of our lifestyle will have to change e.g. our attitude to the car, as well as the way we dispose of waste and consume energy.<BR>

Above all, a sustainable Britain needs political leadership. The benefits for Britain of a sustainable economy and society are well documented and, SERA believes, within our reach. <BR>

This conference will give delegates the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the idea of a sustainable Britain. Throughout the day, senior politicians and environmental commentators will outline their visions of sustainability and delegates will have the opportunity to question and challenge the speakers. 


Workshops on 8 different topics will explore: <BR>
<UL><LI>
How can the government deliver a sustainability programme in this area?
</LI>
<LI>
How can we, as individuals, act sustainably and get others to do so?
</LI></UL>


Delegates will be encouraged to 'pledge' to change at least one aspect of their own life-style, as a result of the day. And finally, SERA will forward the key messages from the conference, to the government. <BR>

Above all, this rally will demonstrate why and how sustainable development should be a priority for Labour's second term.
