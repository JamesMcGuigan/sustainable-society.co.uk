      <p> The revival of a roadmap for peace in the Middle East focuses the mind 

        and our awareness of the importance of solving the Palestinian-Israeli 

        conflict. Centred upon Julia Pascal&#8217;s powerful and moving play, 

        Crossing Jerusalem, this theatre seminar wishes to examine what lies beneath 

        the surface when there is conflict. We will explore what happens when 

        the trust has broken down and there is deep hatred on both sides, which 

        leads to the desire for retribution and the inevitable cycles of violence.<br>

        <br>

        Using experts from the political, NGO, psychotherapeutic and theatre worlds, 

        this event will explore how we need to address, contain and manage these 

        emotions if we are to be serious about lasting change. It will also offer 

        the opportunity of exploring whether there is a place for an international 

        protectorate at a transitional and preparatory stage for a more substantial 

        peace. For anyone committed to seeing an end to this most painful of conflicts, 

        this lively and participatory event should not be missed.</p>

              The play takes place in Jerusalem over 24 hours in March 2002. An

              disturbing questions about loyalty, personal morality and violence.

        &#8230;&#8220;a triumph&#8230;a really good philosophical experience in 

        which people from a range of backgrounds reached out of their disciplines 

        to exchange views and positions. This is very difficult to achieve but 

        you managed it&#8230;&#8221; Senior official, the Cabinet Office, commenting 

        on our previous event at the Barbican.</p>

      <p>&#8220;It was refreshing to see how the limitations of the three disciplines 

        of conflict transformation, drama and process-oriented psychotherapy, 

        were transcended by their interaction. For this reason, it is probably 

        the only good conference I have ever been to, and was at times quite extraordinary. 

        Thank you all.&#8221; David Gee, Quaker and Social Witness comments on 

        our Barbican event</p>

      <p>&#8220;You assembled a terrific group both as panellists and attenders, 

        and the fact that so many of the latter made such significant contributions 

        is a credit to the atmosphere of participation and openness you created. 

        I was particularly struck by the lack of any kind of exclusionary jargon.&#8221; 

        David Edgar, playwright, comments on our Barbican event.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Is the way to solve the world's problems with violence or with 

        discussion and a will to understand? If we want the latter goal to be 

        realised, we should support Peace Direct and its specific commitment to 

        it.&quot; Julie Christie, film actress, after our event at the Opera House.<br>
