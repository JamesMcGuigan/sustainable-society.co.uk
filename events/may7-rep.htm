        <span class="speakers">Michael Linton</span>, founder of 'Open Money' 

        with over 20 years of experience in community currencies <br>

        Chair: <span class="speakers">Dr. Wendy Olsen</span>, Development Researcher, 

        Lecturer in Socio-Economic Research, Manchester University 

       <span class="speakers"><br>
       <br>
       Dr. Wendy Olsen</span> introduced the speakers 

        and mentioned a new radio station: Resonance FM (104.4) which will air 

        the event at some time in the future (see website: www.resonancefm.com).

      <br>
<br>
<span class="speakers">James Robertson</span> began by explaining that 

        in joining the Euro the UK would be undertaking a profoundly undemocratic 

        act. It would reduce control over our economic lives in the UK and in 

        our role in monetary reform. There is however no reason why both the pound 

        and the Euro cannot be used in the UK, as indeed it already is. The majority 

        of people do not understand the effects of such a change in the money 

        supply nor that money can be used to keep people dependent and in that 

        respect represents power. 95% of loans are created from private banks 

        where the interest charges are reflected in the huge profits of the banks. 

        This gives a total &#8216;free lunch&#8217; to the private banks of around 

        &pound;20 billion per year in the UK. The public income from notes and 

        coins amounts to around &pound;3 million, but if currency was introduced 

        from public sources the income that would be generated would be around 

        &pound;45 billion per year for the public purse. What is required is a 

        debt free money supply which would reduce the levels of private debt and 

        stabilise the economy. Environmental campaigners are now beginning to 

        see the need for monetary reform as part of the process to move towards 

        a genuinely democratic, sustainable world. Indeed money system reform 

        is one of the key challenges facing humanity in the first quarter of the 

        21st Century. A fair and efficient system is required. LETS and other 

        alternative currencies are useful and pluralistic, but also a genuine 

        global currency is required. A world currency at the global level could 

        be used to prevent national governments such as the US (through seigniorage 

        of the dollar) receiving an annual &#8216;tribute&#8217; from the rest 

        of the world estimated at $400 billion at least, and provide a fund for 

        public revenue which could be spent on behalf of the world community by 

        the UN or a similar body. Suggestions for individual action included studying 

        the subject, persuading other pressure groups to take the issue seriously, 

        writing to your MP, particularly in support of the EDM 854 (see website: 

        <a href="http://edm.ais.co.uk">http://edm.ais.co.uk</a>).

      <span class="speakers"><br>
      <br>
      Michael Rowbotham</span> spoke of the distinction 

        between money and real wealth (goods and services). He explained the problem 

        of currency devaluation which occurred in South Africa when the Rand fell 

        to 1/3 of its original value. In real terms this meant that 1/3 of the 

        revenue from exports was received and the price of imports was 3 times 

        greater. In order to overcome the problem the country became a mass exporter, 

        but the revenues were still not enough, so the exports continued. This 

        has led to selling of the assets of the county such as land, mineral rights, 

        docks, electricity and water systems in order to meet IMF debt demands. 

        There are many countries in this position now. Corporations can thus &#8216;pick 

        and choose&#8217; from all these nations which are &#8216;selling off 

        the family silver&#8217; of their assets. Hence much of the land and natural 

        resources as well as capital investments of many developing countries 

        are now owned by institutions outside the country&#8217;s borders. Money 

        should be a &#8216;register&#8217; of the value of goods and services, 

        but NOT a commodity itself: it should not be traded as such. A register 

        of values of commodities could be used to ensure that a very similar price 

        is received for all specific type goods of similar quality globally in 

        order to prevent producers making products priced to undermine the same 

        quality product from another source. This would help to provide a common 

        value to wealth which is fundamentally democratic: in other words a fair 

        trading system.

      <span class="speakers"><br>
      <br>
      Prof. Mary Mellor</span> explained that the issue 

        of money creation is a social and political question, not merely an economic 

        one based on a superficial and facile statement such as the view of many 

        economists that &#8216;consumer choice is the only mechanism of democracy&#8217;. 

        Currently the commercial sector decides how money can be made (and lost! 

        Enron simply lost $40 billion &#8211; where did it go?!). The ever increasing 

        debt burden is now being pushed onto the young and the elderly in the 

        form of student loans and equity release. Yet our future cannot be secured 

        in money terms, money is an &#8216;illusion&#8217;, it is not real wealth: 

        it has no real value of itself, it simply provides the possessor with 

        a &#8216;claim&#8217; to wealth. The cooperative movement is a socially 

        minded trading system which used to be very strong and could be rebuilt, 

        but it has been lost to a great extent to capitalism. We need to re-ground 

        ourselves in the really important aspects of society and re-examine the 

        role of the social and public sectors, and our money systems need to be 

        reformed to reflect these deeper values.

      <span class="speakers"><br>
      <br>
      Michael Linton</span> explained the possibility 

        of creating &#8216;virtual&#8217; local currencies in terms of a &#8216;multiple 

        money system&#8217;: Open Money. Currently as money moves around, it tends 

        to always move away, as a result of the current economic paradigm. Yet 

        in a virtual money system trading with &#8216;imaginary&#8217; money, 

        the money comes back, it circulates within the &#8216;community&#8217;. 

        People belong to many &#8216;local&#8217; networks related to their activities 

        and interests such as sports, the arts etc. Each &#8216;type&#8217; of 

        network can have its own currency and this need not be limited to a geographical 

        area, but can also represent a kind of activity. The system operates as 

        follows:<br>

        <br>
        1. Businesses need to be willing to &#8216;create&#8217; and then to donate 

        &#8216;community way&#8217; currency (ie open money) to &#8216;local&#8217; 

        community service groups such as schools and other local charities and/or 

        services which need funding. The business must then be willing to accept 

        the community way currency in exchange for goods and services, however 

        they are not obliged to take the full price of any particular item in 

        local currency and may have a system whereby say 20% of a transaction 

        value (eg a meal in a restaurant) is paid in open money and the balance 

        in hard cash (ie the normal currency such as pounds sterling) as usual. 

        <br>

        <br>
        2. The community service organisation then &#8216;spends&#8217; the local 

        currency into circulation. This is done both by exchange for a service 

        or product from other users of the community way currency and also by 

        means of exchanging &#8216;hard cash&#8217; for the local currency when 

        an individual/organisation donates money to the local charity or service. 

        In this way both parties benefit and those who donate &#8216;hard cash&#8217; 

        to local services receive in exchange the same amount in the local currency 

        (exchange rate should always remain 1 to 1), which they can then spend 

        in one of the local businesses which created the money.<br>

        <br>
        3. People need to be willing to make exchanges within the local community/network, 

        in the local currency.<br>

        <br>
        4. A Community group is required such as London Open Money, which provides 

        a roster of organisations that need money and manages and administers 

        the &#8216;local&#8217; Open Money system. An open money card is proved 

        to the users in which the transaction information is stored.<br>

        <br>
        In this way an additional way of exchanging goods and services is created 

        in any type of &#8216;local community&#8217; in which the &#8216;money&#8217; 

        always circulates within the system and is thus never &#8216;lost&#8217; 

        to an &#8216;absentee&#8217; power structure. 

      The general consensus from the talks and from questions from the floor 

        indicated that the present crisis provides a fairly unique opportunity 

        for reforms since change can occur when the dominant groups lose confidence. 

        But pressure will be required to make the best use of this situation. 

        The main need is to shift the emphasis from the private sector reaping 

        the rewards from money systems, to allowing the public sector to be funded 

        from money supply, which in turn would reduce the need for taxation. <br>
