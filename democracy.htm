            <p>Following the inconclusive outcome of the 2002 World Summit on 
              Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the failure of governments 
              and global institutions to address social and environmental problems 
              is glaringly obvious. We can no longer afford a global system that 
              aims to represent us only in our narrow capacity as consumers. <br>
              The <b>Earth Emergency - A Call to Action</b> initiative together 
              with the <b>World Future Council</b> will seek to link up civil 
              society initiatives around the world to promote the creation of 
              an Earth Democracy forum for people around the world.<br>
              A political and corporate 'bypass' is intended, due to the tendency 
              of self-interested parties to prevent appropriate reforms, which 
              address social and environmental problems, from being implemented.<b> 
              The Earth Emergency</b> link up will enable grassroots initiatives 
              based upon sustainable lifestyles to be directly in touch with an 
              overall global council, the<b> World Future Council</b>, whose role 
              will be to provide moral guidance at the highest level. This will 
              ensure both a bottom up and top down approach to reforms so that 
              our political leaders are pressurised to take appropriate action 
              by both the people and a moral leadership.</p>
