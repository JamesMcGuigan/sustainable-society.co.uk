                  <h4 class="firebrick">London Rebuilding Society Share Issue Launched</h4>
                  <p> In an attempt to find a creative solution to the shortage 
                    of funds for businesses with a social purpose, the London 
                    Rebuilding Society is launching 'Investing in London', an 
                    ethical share issue designed to raise &pound;500,000 to be 
                    channelled into enterprises working in the poorest parts of 
                    London.<br>
                    Potential investors are invited to make a minimum investment 
                    of &pound;250 in shares in the London Rebuilding Society, 
                    which is working to improve Londoners' quality of life by 
                    providing finance and business support to hundreds of social 
                    enterprises, voluntary organisations and community groups. 
                    The funds raised will be invested in enterprises throughout 
                    the capital, and investors will become members of London Rebuilding 
                    Society, which is developing a range of innovative new investment 
                    funds for organisations which trade for community benefit 
                    rather than private profit.<br>
                    Research carried out for the London Rebuilding Society suggests 
                    that traditional financial institutions are failing voluntary, 
                    charity and community groups, leaving the social enterprise 
                    sector overly dependent on inadequate sources of grant funding.<br>
                    A consultation exercise carried out with some of the 30,000 
                    social enterprises registered in London shows that mainstream 
                    financial institutions do not understand the special needs 
                    of such groups, leading them to offer potential clients inappropriate 
                    products and services.
